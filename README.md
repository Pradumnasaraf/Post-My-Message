## 🛠️ Using the Routes

After deploying the API the request will be on {API_BASE_URL}/{route}. This project is deployed with the base URL as `https://post-my-message.vercel.app/`.

**Send a custom message to a number - `/sendsms` POST method.**

It sends a custom message to the number provided. The request body should have a `"phone"` and `"message"`property that contains the receiver's number and a message. The POST body should be in JSON format.

<!-- Note: Sender's number will be your Twilio number, which you configure in the [.env](/.env_sample) -->

```JSON
{
    "message": "Hey, this message is from Twilio",
    "phone": "+111111111111"
}
```

**Send a random quote to a number - `/sendquote` POST method.**

It sends a random quote to the number provided. The request body should have a `"phone"` property that contains the receiver's number. The POST body should be in JSON format.

```JSON
{
    "phone": "+111111111111"
}
```

## 👨‍💻 Developing the API

This section includes how to test and develop API at your end. You can either run it in the cloud using **Gitpod** or run it inside a container using **docker** or choose to set up the complete environment locally.
